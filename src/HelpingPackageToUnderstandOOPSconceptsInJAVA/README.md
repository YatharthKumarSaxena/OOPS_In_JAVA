# Hello  Everyone , I am the README.md file of this folder to assist you 
# This folder consist of some programs of OOPS in Java which give me an idea of :-
# 1.) Access Modifiers :- public, private and default in JAVA
# 2.) How these access modifiers work
# 3.) Constructor can be made public , private and default for both default and parameterized constructor
# 4.) Default constructor can be declared once only , different default constructor like public , private and default cannot exist at the same time , only one of them can be declared 
# 5.) Parameterized Constructor can be multiple in a class by changing the arrangement and number of arguments
# 6.) Final keyword is used to set a value of data member of a class permanently , for final keyword , initialization of value of data member at the time of declaration in class is compulsory
# 7.) If a final keyword is used on the data member then it's value cannot be changed
# 8.) Static keyword works in JAVA as same as that in C++.
# 9.) Static Member can be accessed by class this holds true for both functions and data members
