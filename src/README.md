# Java OOPS Foundation Repository

Hello Everyone 👋  

This repository represents the initial phase of my journey in learning Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) in Java. The primary purpose of creating this repo was to build a strong foundation so that I could begin my Low-Level Design (LLD) journey in Java.

---

## 📌 About This Repository

- This is NOT a project or a fully structured production-level work like my other repositories.
- It documents how I started learning Java using my prior programming experience in C++.
- The learning and implementation captured here were completed within a short span of 1–2 days.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

Through this repository, I focused on:

- Understanding core OOPS concepts in Java
- Translating my C++ programming logic into Java
- Writing basic Java programs using OOPS principles
- Building the groundwork required for System Design in Java (LLD)

I have not mastered Java completely yet, but this repository serves as my foundation for deeper design and development concepts.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- Language: Java  
- IDE: IntelliJ IDEA  
- Version Control: Git & GitHub  

Additionally, I learned:

- How to use IntelliJ IDEA for Java development
- How to connect and push Java projects from IntelliJ to GitHub

## 📂 Repository Structure

This repository currently contains 4 folders, each covering basic Java programs and OOPS practice implementations.

All programs have been tested to ensure they run correctly. However, improvements are always welcome.

## 🤝 Feedback & Contributions

If you find:

- Any logical mistake  
- Code optimization opportunity  
- Syntax or structural issue  

Please feel free to suggest improvements or raise a pull request.

Constructive feedback is always appreciated.

## 🚀 Future Scope

This repository will act as the stepping stone for:

- Advanced Java concepts  
- Low-Level Design implementations  
- Scalable backend system design in Java  

Thank you for visiting this repository.
