# ðŸ§  OOPS_In_JAVA

This repository reflects my **personal practice** in Java OOPs â€” it's not an open-source library or collaborative project.

Go to the `src` folder â€” there you can see all the **practice work** Iâ€™ve done.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why I Made This Repo

- I already had a strong grip on **OOPs in C++**, along with a good understanding of **design principles** and **design patterns**.
- My **Sir guided us in implementing Low-Level Design (LLD)** in Java â€” and I wanted to **relate Java syntax and structure** with what I already knew.
- I didnâ€™t aim to go overboard. I just practiced **enough** to become confident and capable of designing LLD structures in Java.

## ðŸ›  What You'll Find Inside

- Each Java file in `src/` demonstrates a **core OOP concept**, like inheritance, abstraction, interfaces, etc.
- This is the **foundation** of my **LLD journey in Java** â€” and helped me bridge the gap from C++ to Java smoothly.

## ðŸ§¾ Note

This is not a production-level or fully polished codebase.  
It's **just the amount of practice** I personally needed to feel ready. ðŸ’¡
